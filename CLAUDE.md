# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Secure, standards-compliant iframe integration using Apache as an SSL terminator and OAuth2/OIDC enforcement point.

## Current State

This project is in its initial stage — no source code, build system, or tests have been implemented yet. The repository currently contains only the README, LICENSE (Apache 2.0), and project scaffolding.

## Planned Architecture

- **Apache** serves as the SSL/TLS termination layer and OAuth2/OIDC enforcement point
- **OAuth2/OIDC** handles authentication and authorization
- **iframe integration** provides the frontend embedding mechanism
